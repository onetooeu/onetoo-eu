ONETOO Patch (Audit text + re-audit scripts)
==========================================

What this patch does
- Adds a cleaned, copy-paste safe audit note (Markdown) that fixes the messy table + wording.
- Adds local re-audit scripts (bash + PowerShell) to re-check deploy/sha256 consistency.

How to apply
Option A (recommended): copy files manually
- Copy the folder `docs/audit/` into your repo (create folders if missing)
- Copy the folder `scripts/local/` into your repo

Option B: apply the unified diff patch (git apply)
- From repo root:
    git apply PATCH_ONETOO_AUDIT_FIX.patch

Then run:
- Bash (Git Bash / Linux / macOS):
    bash scripts/local/re-audit.sh

- PowerShell (Windows):
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/local/re-audit.ps1

Notes
- The scripts are read-only: they only curl + grep and print results.
- They assume these endpoints exist:
    https://www.onetoo.eu/.well-known/deploy.txt
    https://www.onetoo.eu/.well-known/sha256.json
    https://onetoo-eu.pages.dev/.well-known/deploy.txt
    https://onetoo-eu.pages.dev/.well-known/sha256.json
- They also check search.onetoo.eu health endpoints (expected to be 404 per current audit).
