  <h1>Affiliate Disclosure</h1>

  <p><strong>Status:</strong> <span>Disabled</span></p>

  <p>
    ONETOO.eu is operated as a <strong>public-good trust and governance hub</strong>.
    It does not run an affiliate program and does not monetize outbound links.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>No affiliate tracking parameters are added by ONETOO.eu</li>
    <li>No commissions, referral fees, or performance marketing arrangements are active</li>
    <li>No paid placements or pay-to-rank mechanisms exist in this trust surface</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This page exists for <strong>compatibility and transparency</strong> only.
    If external websites independently use tracking or affiliate systems, that is outside of ONETOO.eu control.
  </p>

  <p>
    If this ever changes in the future, ONETOO.eu will publish an explicit, versioned policy update
    (and include it in the transparency and governance artifacts).
